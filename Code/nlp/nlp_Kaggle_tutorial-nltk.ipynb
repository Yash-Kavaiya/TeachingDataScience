    "## What is Natural Language Processing(NLP) ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand the concept of NLP in detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into details of NLP first let us try to answer the below question \n",
    "\n",
    "- What natural language is and how it is different from other types of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other namely speech and text.We are surrounded by text.\n",
    "Think about how much text you see each day:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Signs\n",
    "- Menus\n",
    "- Email\n",
    "- SMS\n",
    "- Web Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "and so much moreâ€¦\n",
    "\n",
    "The list is endless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about speech.We may speak to each other, as a species, more than we write. It may even be easier to learn to speak than to write.Voice and text are how we communicate with each other.Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets get into details of this tutorial. "

    "The NLTK module is a massive tool kit, aimed at helping with the entire Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology. NLTK will aid with everything from splitting sentences from paragraphs, splitting up words, recognizing the part of speech of those words, highlighting the main subjects, and then even with helping machine to understand what the text is all about. In this tutorial, we're going to tackle the field of opinion mining, or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our path to learning how to do sentiment analysis with NLTK, we're going to learn the following:\n",

    "- Tokenizing - Splitting sentences and words from the body of text.\n",
    "- Part of Speech tagging\n",
    "- Machine Learning with the Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "- How to tie in Scikit-learn (sklearn) with NLTK\n",
    "- Training classifiers with datasets\n",
    "- Performing live, streaming, sentiment analysis with Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "...and much more.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking up the given text into units called tokens. The tokens may be words or number or punctuation mark or even sentences. Tokenization does this task by locating word boundaries. Ending point of a word and beginning of the next word is called word boundaries. Tokenization is also known as word segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Challenges in tokenization</b> depends on the type of language. Languages such as English and French are referred to as space-delimited as most of the words are separated from each other by white spaces. Languages such as Chinese and Thai are referred to as unsegmented as words do not have clear boundaries. Tokenising unsegmented language sentences requires additional lexical and morphological information. Tokenization is also affected by writing system and the typographical structure of the words. Structures of languges can be grouped into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Isolating: Words do not divide into smaller units. Example: Mandarin Chinese\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Agglutinative: Words divide into smaller units. Example: Japanese, Tamil\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Inflectional: Boundaries between morphemes are not clear and ambiguous in terms of grammatical meaning. Example: Latin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand some more basic terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is Corpora?\n",

    "- What is Lexicon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicon is nothing but words and their means .E.g Investor speak vs. Regular English speak\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e Investor talk about \"BULL\" as some stock going positive in the market which bullish as to the regular word of \"BULL\" describing the usual animal.\n",

The idea is to group nouns with the words that are in relation to them.\n",
