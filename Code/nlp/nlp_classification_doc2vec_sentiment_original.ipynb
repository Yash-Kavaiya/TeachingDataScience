    "Word2Vec is dope. In short, it takes in a corpus, and churns out vectors for each of those words. What's so special about these vectors you ask? Well, similar words are near each other. Furthermore, these vectors represent how we use the words. For example, `v_man - v_woman` is approximately equal to `v_king - v_queen`, illustrating the relationship that \"man is to woman as king is to queen\". This process, in NLP voodoo, is called **word embedding**. These representations have been applied widely. This is made even more awesome with the introduction of Doc2Vec that represents not only words, but entire sentences and documents. Imagine being able to represent an entire sentence using a fixed-length vector and proceeding to run all your standard classification algorithms. Isn't that amazing?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Word2Vec documentation is shit. The C-code is nigh unreadable (700 lines of highly optimized, and sometimes weirdly optimized code). I personally spent a lot of time untangling Doc2Vec and crashing into ~50% accuracies due to implementation mistakes. This tutorial aims to help other users get off the ground using Word2Vec for their own research. We use Word2Vec for **sentiment analysis** by attempting to classify the Cornell IMDB movie review corpus (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/).\n",

    "### Feeding Data to Doc2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec (the portion of `gensim` that implements the Doc2Vec algorithm) does a great job at word embedding, but a terrible job at reading in files. It only takes in `LabeledLineSentence` classes which basically yields `LabeledSentence`, a class from `gensim.models.doc2vec` representing a single sentence. Why the \"Labeled\" word? Well, here's how Doc2Vec differs from Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec simply converts a word into a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec not only does that, but also aggregates all the words in a sentence into a vector. To do that, it simply treats a sentence label as a special word, and does some voodoo on that special word. Hence, that special word is a label for a sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we have to format sentences into\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[['word1', 'word2', 'word3', 'lastword'], ['label1']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`LabeledSentence` is simply a tidier way to do that. It contains a list of words, and a label for the sentence. We don't really need to care about how `LabeledSentence` works exactly, we just have to know that it stores those two things -- a list of words and a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need a way to convert our new line separated corpus into a collection of `LabeledSentence`s. The default constructor for the default `LabeledLineSentence` class in Doc2Vec can do that for a single text file, but can't do that for multiple files. In classification tasks however, we usually deal with multiple documents (test, training, positive, negative etc). Ain't that annoying?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we write our own `LabeledLineSentence` class. The constructor takes in a dictionary that defines the files to read and the label prefixes sentences from that document should take on. Then, Doc2Vec can either read the collection directly via the iterator, or we can access the array directly. We also need a function to return a permutated version of the array of `LabeledSentence`s. We'll see why later on."
