This repository contains the work and progress for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 project "Towards a Neural Extraction Framework" for DBpedia.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a neural extraction framework for DBpedia, improving upon the current extraction framework by leveraging machine learning techniques. This project aims to enhance the quality and coverage of structured data extracted from Wikipedia and other sources.

### Key Objectives

- Implement neural network models for entity and relation extraction
- Develop clustering algorithms with predicate suggestion
- Integrate the new framework with existing DBpedia infrastructure
- Improve extraction accuracy and efficiency

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- SPARQL knowledge

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dbpedia/neural-extraction-framework.git
   cd neural-extraction-framework
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

(Include instructions on how to run the framework, example commands, etc.)
