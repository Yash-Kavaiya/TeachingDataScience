\begin{frame}\frametitle{Introduction: The Growing Need for Text-to-SQL}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Exponential growth in data volumes makes manual exploration inefficient
        \item Organizations increasingly rely on relational databases for data management
        \item Text-to-SQL bridges human language and database interaction
        \item Democratizes data access by enabling non-technical users to query databases
        \item Accelerates insights retrieval without dependence on SQL experts
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Benefits of Text-to-SQL}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Empowers non-technical users for independent data access
        \item Accelerates query creation and data retrieval
        \item Enables more agile and informed business decisions
        \item Reduces dependency on technical teams for routine reports
        \item Lowers training costs by eliminating need for SQL training
        \item Minimizes human errors in SQL syntax through AI-generated queries
        \item Increases overall productivity by focusing on insights rather than query building

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Historical Evolution of Text-to-SQL}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Early Rule-Based Systems (1970s-1990s)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Pattern matching and grammar rules
            \item Effective for simple queries but limited scalability
          \end{itemize}
        \item Statistical and Semantic Parsing (1990s-2000s)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Probabilistic models and syntactic analysis
            \item Improved language variability handling but struggled with complex queries
          \end{itemize}
        \item Machine Learning Era (2010s)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Neural networks, LSTMs, self-attention mechanisms
            \item Better context understanding and generalization
          \end{itemize}
        \item Generative AI/LLMs (2020s)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Exceptional language understanding and code generation
            \item Handles complex queries across diverse schemas
          \end{itemize}
