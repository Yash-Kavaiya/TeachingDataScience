\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Prompt Engineering?}

\begin{itemize}
\item For prompt \lstinline|What is 1,000,000 * 9,000?| GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) (an AI) sometimes answers 9,000,000 (incorrect). This is where prompt engineering comes in.
\item If, instead of asking What is \lstinline|1,000,000 * 9,000?|, we ask \lstinline|What is 1,000,000 * 9,000? Make sure to put the right amount of zeros, even if there are many:|, GPT-3 will answer 9,000,000,000 (correct). 
\item Why is this the case? Why is the additional specification of the number of zeros necessary for the AI to get the right answer? How can we create prompts that yield optimal results on our task? 			
\item That's Prompt Engineering.

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Settings of Prompt}

\begin{itemize}
\item 'temperature':  before applying the softmax function, temperature is used scale the logits. With it, creativity or variability is allowed. If you re-run the prompt, with 0, no change, but with 1, lots of variation. Default is 0.7. With a temperature between 0 and 1, we can control the randomness and creativity of the model's predictions. Temperature defines how likely it is to choose less probable words. T=0 gives the same response every time because there's a 0% chance to choose any word but the most likely. T=1 just picks based on the model's base confidence.
\item 'top\_p' or 'nucleus sampling': specifies a sampling threshold during inference time, words passing the threshold are sampled for the output. Top-p goes for a minimal set of words, the probability of which does not exceed exceeds p. In practice, this means the following: if you choose reasonably high p, like 0.9, you would likely get a set of the most likely words for the model to choose from
\item Like the temperature, the top p parameter controls the randomness and originality of the model.
\item OpenAI documentation recommends using either one parameter or the other and setting the unused parameter to the neutral case, i.e. 1.0.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{LLM Inference Parameters}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Context Window: Maximum text for response generation combining prompt and completion tokens.
        \item Max Tokens: Maximum number of tokens in the generated response, influencing length.
        \item Temperature: Controls randomness; higher values (e.g., 1.0) for diversity, lower values (e.g., 0.2) for focus.
        \item Top P: Nucleus sampling, defines cumulative probability distribution for token selection.
        \item Top N: Similar to Top P but considers only top N likely tokens for response generation.
        \item Presence Penalty: Discourages model from mentioning specific words or phrases.
        \item Frequency Penalty: Controls repetition of words or phrases in the generated output.

Let's think step by step.

First, you started with 10 apples.
You gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left.
Then you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples.

Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill.
Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill.
How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?

Answer:

It takes Tom 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 minutes to climb the hill.
It takes Tom 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to climb the hill.

Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes.
Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92.
Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?

Answer:
The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19.
The total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $<<19+92=111>>111.
Jack needs $111 - $40 = $<<111-40=71>>71 more.
So the answer is 71.

working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations \
as a function of the number of square feet.
``` 
Student's solution:
```
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
```

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Strategies to Get Better Results Using Prompt Engineering}

\begin{itemize}
\item Write clear instructions: Be specific about the desired length, format, or persona for the output. For example, you can ask the model to provide a 3-4 sentence summary in a formal tone, or adopt the persona of a witty comedian while generating a response.
\item Provide reference text: Include relevant reference text that can guide the model and improve the accuracy of the output. Reference materials can be used as study notes, helping the model stay on track and avoid hallucinated responses.
\item Break down complex tasks: Divide complex tasks into smaller subtasks to improve accuracy. For example, if handling an inbound support request, first use an API call to categorize the message, and then generate a response based on the category identified. Breaking down the task into manageable steps reduces error rates and yields better results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Strategies to Get Better Results Using Prompt Engineering}

\begin{itemize}
\item Encourage thinking: Prompt the LLM to outline its thinking process to promote reasoning and improve response accuracy. By asking the model to explain its thought process, you can guide it towards more accurate and logical outputs.
\item Leverage external tools: Complement the capabilities of the LLM by utilizing external tools. For instance, integrate a text retrieval system or a code execution engine. You can even generate code with GPT to call external APIs for performing specific tasks. This combination of GPT and external tools expands the model's capabilities.
\item Evaluate changes systematically: Iteratively refine the prompt for optimal performance. Establish a comprehensive test suite that represents real-world usage, contains diverse test cases, and can be automated or repeated easily. Use this test suite to evaluate and compare the model's outputs against benchmark answers. Evaluations can involve computer-based assessments, human assessments, or a combination of both to ensure improvements in performance.
