\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Challenges in Standard RAG}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lack of Explainability:} Hard to trace the source of retrieved information.
        \item \textbf{Local Window:} Limited chunk-level context leads to incomplete responses.
        \item \textbf{Scalability Issues:} Struggles with large-scale medical and legal corpora.
        \item \textbf{Loss of Structural Relationships:} Ignores hierarchical relationships in data.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Features of GraphRAG}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Structured Representation:} Uses knowledge graphs.
        \item \textbf{Contextual Retrieval:} Understands semantic relationships.
        \item \textbf{Efficient Processing:} Reduces computational cost.
        \item \textbf{Multi-Faceted Queries:} Synthesizes data from multiple sources.
        \item \textbf{Explainability:} More transparent than black-box models.
        \item \textbf{Continuous Learning:} Expands knowledge over time.
