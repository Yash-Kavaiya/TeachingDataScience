   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Basic Outline of Dynamic Programming}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To solve a problem, we need a collection of sub-problems that
    satisfy a few properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item There are a polynomial number of sub-problems.
    \item The solution to the problem can be computed easily from the
      solutions to the sub-problems.
    \item There is a natural ordering of the sub-problems from
      ``smallest'' to ``largest''.
    \item There is an easy-to-compute recurrence that allows us to
      compute the solution to a sub-problem from the solutions to some
      smaller sub-problems.
    \end{enumerate} 
  \item Difficulties in designing dynamic programming algorithms:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Which sub-problems to define?
    \item How can we tie together sub-problems using a recurrence?
    \item How do we order the sub-problems (to allow iterative
      computation of optimal solutions to sub-problems)?

   \begin{frame}[fragile]{History of Dynamic Programming}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bellman pioneered the systematic study of dynamic programming in
    the 1950s.  

%   \item Dynamic programming = ``planning over time.''
  \item The Secretary of Defense at that time was hostile to mathematical research.
  \item Bellman sought an impressive name to avoid confrontation. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``it's impossible to use dynamic in a pejorative sense''
    \item ``something not even a Congressman could object to''
      (Ref:{(Bellman, R. E., \emph{Eye of the Hurricane, An
        Autobiography})}).

  \item Operations research: Bellman-Ford algorithm for shortest path
    routing in networks.
  \item Control theory: Viterbi algorithm for hidden Markov models.

   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}
Given an array $\mathrm{arr}[0]$, $\mathrm{arr}[1]$, \ldots, $\mathrm{arr}[n-1]$ of integers, find the interval with the highest sum


    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            -15 & {8} & {-2} & {1} & {0} & {6} & -3 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The maximum sum of an interval in this array is $13$

        \item But how do we solve this in general?
            \begin{itemize}
        \item Easy to loop through all $\approx n^2$ intervals, and calculate their sums, but that is $O(n^3)$
        \item We could use our static range sum trick to get this down to $O(n^2)$
        \item Can we do better with dynamic programming?
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item First step is to formulate this recursively
        \item Let $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i)$ be the maximum sum interval in the range $0,\ldots,i$
        \item Base case: $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(0) = \mathrm{max}(0, arr[0])$
        \item What about $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i)$?
        \item What does $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i-1)$ return?
        \item Is it possible to combine solutions to subproblems with smaller $i$ into a solution for $i$?
        \item At least it's not obvious...
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let's try changing perspective

    \item Let $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i)$ be the maximum sum interval in the range $0,\ldots,i$, \textit{that ends at $i$}

        \item Base case: $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(0) = arr[0]$

    \item $\mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i) = \mathrm{max}(arr[i], arr[i] + \mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i - 1))$

        \item Then the answer is just $\mathrm{max}_{\ 0 \leq i < n}\ \{\ \mathrm{max\_{}sum}(i)\ \}$
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}
 Next step is to turn this into a function

    \begin{lstlisting}
int arr[1000];

int max_sum(int i) {
    if (i == 0) {
        return arr[i];
    }

    int res = max(arr[i], arr[i] + max_sum(i - 1));

    return res;
}
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}
Final step is to memoize the function

    \begin{lstlisting}
int arr[1000];
int mem[1000];
bool comp[1000];
memset(comp, 0, sizeof(comp));

int max_sum(int i) {
    if (i == 0) {
        return arr[i];
    }
    if (comp[i]) {
        return mem[i];
    }

    int res = max(arr[i], arr[i] + max_sum(i - 1));

    mem[i] = res;
    comp[i] = true;
    return res;
}
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}
Then the answer is just the maximum over all interval ends.     If you want to find the maximum sum interval in multiple arrays, remember to clear the memory in between



    \begin{lstlisting}
int maximum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    maximum = max(maximum, best_sum(i));
}

printf("%d\n", maximum);
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Maximum sum}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What about time complexity?
        \item There are $n$ possible inputs to the function
        \item Each input is processed in $O(1)$ time, assuming recursive calls are $O(1)$
        \item Time complexity is $O(n)$
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Coin change}
    \begin{itemize}
\item We have some amount, say, 37/-, split into coins, with aim to have minimum number of coins. 
\item Coins denomination available are 10, 5, 2, 1.
\item Greedy approach: Max first: 10,10,10,5,2. 
\item Greedy strategy: Subtract with max till possible, then the next max and so on.
\item For 23/- with coins as 1,4,5?
\item Greedy: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1. So, 7 coins.
\item But better solution would have been: 5 + 5+ 5+4+4. So, 5 coins.

            and some amount $x$: What is minimum number of coins needed to
            represent the value $x$?

        \item Remember the greedy algorithm for Coin change?
        \item It didn't always give the optimal solution, and sometimes it didn't even give a solution at all...

        \item What about dynamic programming?
    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Coin change}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First step: formulate the problem recursively
\item Let $\mathrm{opt}(i,x)$ denote the minimum number of coins needed to represent the value $x$ if we're only allowed to use coin denominations $d_0$, \ldots, $d_i$
        \item Base case: $\mathrm{opt}(i,x) = \infty$ if $x < 0$
        \item Base case: $\mathrm{opt}(i,0) = 0$
        \item Base case: $\mathrm{opt}(-1,x) = \infty$
\item $\mathrm{opt}(i,x) = \mathrm{min} \left\{

\frametitle{Terminology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nodes - sometimes called vertices, points, etc. 
\item Edges - sometimes called arcs, lines, etc.

\item Two nodes linked by an edge are \color{blue}adjacent \color{black} or, simply \color{blue}linked\color{black}.

\item For directed graphs, an edge $e$ from node $A$ to node $B$, is said to have $A$ as
its \color{blue}source \color{black} node (or start or origin node) and $B$ as its \color{blue}target \color{black} node (or end or finish or destination node).

\item An edge is  \color{blue}incident \color{black} on a node if it has the node as source or target (directed) or
if it links the node to another (undirected).

\item For an undirected graphs, the number of edges incident at a node is the  \color{blue}degree \color{black} of the node.
For directed graphs, the number of edges whose source is a node, is the  \color{blue}out-degree \color{black} of the node, likewise targets and  \color{blue}in-degree \color{black}.

and linking edges, but with all edges in the same direction. 

\item If there is a path from node $A$ to node $B$, we say $B$ is \color{blue}reachable \color{black} from $A$.

\item A path from a node to itself is a \color{blue}cycle\color{black}.

\item Two nodes in a directed graph are \color{blue}connected \color{black} 
if there is a sequence of adjacent nodes between them. (Notice that the edges can be in any direction between nodes in the sequence.)

$G$ and whose edges have the same source and target as those of $G$.

\item A \color{blue}connected component \color{black} (sometimes, just a `component') of a graph $G$, is a largest
connected subgraph (i.e.~one that cannot be expanded with additional nodes without 
becoming disconnected).

\item Every graph can be partitioned into disjoint connected components. 

\item \color{blue}Question\color{black}: How do we compute the components of a graph efficiently? Is there a quadratic algorithm O($N^2$) or even a linear algorithm O($N$), where $N$ is the number of nodes - what about the number of edges?

\begin{itemize}
\item These are both \color{blue}tabular \color{black} representations. The exact choice of types to represent them depends on the application. 

For example, an adjacency list may be an array of linked lists, if we wish to have fast 
(random) access to the lists of adjacent nodes, but to iterate through these lists.

\item Notice how  \color{blue}sparse \color{black} the adjacency matrix is: most entries are zero as there are few edges in the graph.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Representing graphs: Notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item The representations need modification to include various data. For example, for a  \color{blue}multigraph\color{black}, we may record the edges as well as the adjacent nodes in a list representation, or the number of edges in a matrix representation. Also for  \color{blue}edge-weighted graphs, \color{black} we include the weights in the representation.

\item Notice that for undirected graphs, the matrix is  \color{blue}symmetrical\color{black}.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{itemize}
\item Adjacency matrices allow us to do  \color{blue}arithmetic\color{black}! We may add and multiply matrices, take determinants etc. These determine transformations of graphs and values derived from graphs.

\item \color{blue}Different representations for different tasks\color{black}: We choose which representation to use
by considering the efficiency of an algorithm for the task. 

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}[fragile]

\color{blue}Example\color{black}: Consider the task of finding whether there is a path of length 2 from a given node
$S$ to another node $T$. For adjacency lists, we consider the list of nodes adjacent to
$S$ - in the worst case this is of length $E$ (the number of edges of the graph). For each node
in this list we see whether $T$ is in its list. Thus the worst-case time complexity is 
$E\times E$. Using adjacency matrices, this complexity is $N$ (the number of nodes) - why?

In general, for path finding algorithms, adjacency lists are sometimes more efficient, 
adjacency matrices for other algorithms.

\frametitle{Traversals: Trees}

A traversal of a tree or graph is a means of visiting the nodes using the edges and
revisits of nodes. Usually, there are rules to determine possible next nodes to 
visit or revisit.

There are many techniques, the most widely used are \color{blue}Depth-First Search \color{black} and \color{blue}Breadth-First Search\color{black}.

For \color{red}trees\color{black}, we start at the root and: 

\begin{itemize}
\item For \color{blue}Depth-First Search \color{black} (DFS), visit all descendants of a node, before visiting sibling nodes;
\item For  \color{blue}Breadth-First Search \color{black} (BFS), visit all children of a node, then all grandchildren, etc;

Now let trees have a \color{blue}numerical priority\color{black}\ assigned to each node.

A \color{red}priority search\color{black}\ is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Visit the root.
\item At each step, visit a node that has \color{blue}{highest priority}\ amongst unvisited children of visited nodes.
\end{enumerate}

Priority searches are often used to implement \color{blue}{heuristic search methods}\ where the priority is calculated at each node to provide an indication of whether a route through this node is likely to reach a required goal.

\frametitle{Generic search routine for trees}

We now show how we can code \alert{all} the above search techniques (traversals) of tree \color{blue}with the same program\color{black}.

The program uses an auxiliary date structure with operations \color{blue}push, pop, top, empty\color{black}.

\begin{itemize}
\item When the data structure is a \alert{stack}\ the traversal is \color{blue}{DFS},
\item When the data structure is a \alert{queue}\ the traversal is \color{blue}{BFS},
\item When the data structure is a \alert{priority queue}\ the traversal is a \color{blue}{priority search}.
\end{itemize}

A tree is a directed graph such that:

To modify tree traversal for graphs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We may revisit nodes: so mark nodes as visited/unvisited and only continue traversal from unvisited nodes.
\item There may not be one node from which all others are reachable: so choose node, perform traversal, then start traversal again from any unvisited nodes.

\color{red}A brief overview of some topics in graph theory, looking at algorithms available\color{black}:

Many graph algorithms are based on the traversals:  \color{blue}DFS, BFS and Priority Search\color{black}. 

For example, there are efficient (usually linear) algorithms based on \color{blue}Depth-First Search\color{black}\ for:

\begin{itemize}
\item finding the connected components of a graph (how? - consider the case of undirected graphs),
\item detecting cycles in a graph,
\item finding `strong components' of a graph, 
\item planarity testing and embedding (see below), 
\item articulation points and blocks of undirected graphs, 
`orient-ability' and `reducibility' of graphs, etc.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Survey of graph algorithms: Path finding}

There are numerous \color{blue}path-finding problems\color{black}\ in graphs and a variety of algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\item To find all paths between all pairs of nodes (`transitive closure'), or
\item To find all paths between a fixed pair of nodes, or
\item To find all paths from one node to all others (the `single source problem').
\end{itemize}

When the edges are labelled with numerical values, then we can ask for \color{blue}{shortest paths}\color{black},
by which we mean a path of minimum length, where the length of a path is the sum of 
its edge labels. 

Each problem above yields a shortest path problem - an example of an \color{blue}optimization problem\color{black}.

In fact, the second and third problems are equivalent.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Survey of graph algorithms: Path finding (continued)}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is an \alert{optimization property} concerning shortest paths:

\begin{quote}
If $p$ is a shortest path from node $u$ to node $v$ via node $w$, then the portions 
of $p$ from $u$ to $w$ and from $w$ to $v$ are both shortest paths.
\end{quote}

\item Proof: Evident!

\item Such optimization properties mean that there are direct methods of computing 
shortest paths: To accumulate shortest paths we need combine only other shortest paths 
(and not consider any other paths).

\item This is the basis of both \color{blue}Floyd's Algorithm\color{black}\ and \color{blue}Dijkstra's Algorithm\color{black}.

\item Planarity is about \color{blue}depicting graphs in 2-D space\color{black}: how do we `draw' graphs and 
can we do so without edges crossing.

\item \color{blue}{\bf Definition}\color{black}: An \alert{embedding} of a (directed or undirected) graph in the plane is an allocation of distinct points in the plane
to the nodes and distinct continuous lines (not necessarily straight - that is another problem) to the edges, so that no two lines intersect.

\item There may be more than one `way' of embedding a graph in the plane. \color{blue}Can all graphs be embedded in the plane?\color{black}\ \alert{No!}

\item A graph that can be embedded in the plane is called a \color{blue}{planar}\color{black}\ graph.

Now we are going to think of our edges as pipes of varying sizes and our vertices as places where the pipes run together and the material we are piping can change direction.  Since pipes either flow one way or the other, we will be working with digraphs.  To model the fact that the pipes can be different sizes, we will assign a {\it capacity\/} to each arc, which we will write next to the arc.  We also have a {\it source\/}, which is where the things are being pumped from, and a {\it sink\/}, which is where the things are being pumped to.  I will always label the source $1$ and give the greatest label to the sink.  What we get when we do this is called a {\it network\/}.  Figure 6 shows a network.

Let us give the various arc capacities names before going on:
$$
c_{i,j}
=
\mbox{the capacity of the arc from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ ($0$ if there is no such arc).}
$$

We could put these into a matrix if we wanted.  Below is the capacity matrix for the graph in Figure 6.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Networks and Flows}


We want to figure out how to pump the maximum amount possible from the source to the sink.  In doing so we will construct a {\it flow\/}.  A flow will tell each pipe how much stuff to, well, pipe.  So a flow will be specified by a set of numbers $x_{i,j}$ which tell how much stuff the pipe from $i$ to $j$ will pipe.  (Like the $c_{i,j}$s, we will have $x_{i,j}=0$ if there is no arc from $i$ to $j$.)

Flows have to satisfy several restrictions.  First, a flow can't have a pipe piping more than it can pipe, so we will insist that
\begin{eqnarray}\label{flow1}
x_{i,j}&\le&c_{i,j}\mbox{ for all valid $i$ and $j$.}
\end{eqnarray}

But we're getting ahead of ourselves.  The first constraint we should have noticed is that pipes can't pipe negative amounts:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{flow2}
x_{i,j}&\ge&0\mbox{ for all valid $i$ and $j$.}
\end{eqnarray}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Networks and Flows}


The third and final constraint is known as Kirchkoff's Law.  It says that the amount flowing into a vertex must equal the amount flowing out of the vertex (unless that vertex is the source or the sink).  This comes from the fact that our vertices are just intersections, and don't have any storage capacity of their own.  The amount flowing out of vertex $i$ is given by
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{i,k},
$$
where $n$ is the number of vertices in our network, and the amount flowing into vertex $i$ is given by
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{k,i}.
$$
So in mathematical terms Kirchkoff's Law says
\begin{eqnarray}\label{flow3}
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{i,k}&=&\sum_{k=1}^n x_{k,i}\mbox{ for all valid $i$ except for the source and the sink.}
\end{eqnarray}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Networks and Flows}


That's it for the constraints.  What about the objective function?  We want to maximize the amount of stuff that gets pumped from the source to the sink.  Because of Kirchkoff's Law, everything that leaves the source must eventually get to the sink, so the amount of stuff that gets pumped from the source to the sink is
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{1,k}.
$$
(Here we are using our convention that the source is vertex $1$.)  By Kirchkoff's Law again, this is the same as the amount of stuff that enters the sink:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{k,n}.
$$
(And here we are using our convention that the sink is vertex $n$.)

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Networks and Flows}


Putting this, (\ref{flow1}), (\ref{flow2}), and (\ref{flow3}) together, we can write the problem as a linear programming problem.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{Maximize $z=\sum_{k=1}^n x_{1,k}$}\\
\mbox{subject to}\\
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{i,k}&=&\sum_{k=1}^n x_{k,i}\mbox{ for all $i$ between $2$ and $n-1$}\\
x_{i,j}&\le&c_{i,j}\mbox{ for all $i$ and $j$ between $1$ and $n$}\\
x_{i,j}&\ge&0\mbox{ for all $i$ and $j$ between $1$ and $n$}
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Networks and Flows}

Since we usually like to get all our variables on the left-hand side, we can rewrite this as
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{Maximize $z=\sum_{k=1}^n x_{1,k}$}\\
\mbox{subject to}\\
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sum_{k=1}^n x_{i,k}-\sum_{k=1}^n x_{k,i}&=&0\mbox{ for all $i$ between $2$ and $n-1$}\\
x_{i,j}&\le&c_{i,j}\mbox{ for all $i$ and $j$ between $1$ and $n$}\\
x_{i,j}&\ge&0\mbox{ for all $i$ and $j$ between $1$ and $n$}
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

Now we just have to solve this!  But, there are $n^2$ variables and $2n^2+n$ constraints, so the Simplex Method might not be the way to go.  Instead, we will use the...

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}


The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is really quite natural.  We start with no flow at all, that is, with every $x_{i,j}$ set equal to $0$.  Then we find what is called an {\it augmenting path\/} from the source to the sink.  This is, as it says, a path from the source to the sink, that has excess capacity.  We then figure out how much more we could pipe down that path and add this to the flow we are building.

We will apply the algorithm to the network from Figure 6.  We start with the flow set equal to 0 everywhere:

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}

Now we need to find an augmenting path.  There are millions of them (well, maybe not exactly millions, I count six).  Let take the path $1\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 6$ to start with.  Now we have to figure out what how much more stuff we can pipe down this route.  The pipe from $1\rightarrow 3$ has capacity $9$ ($c_{1,3}=9$), and is currently piping $0$ ($x_{1,3}=0$ right now), so it could pipe $9$ more.  The pipe from $3\rightarrow 6$ has capacity $2$ and is currently piping $0$, so it could pipe $2$ more.  We can only pipe the minimum of these numbers, so we will only be able to send $2$ units of stuff down this path.

Then we update the flow:

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}

We are now ready to repeat.  Let's take the augmenting path $1\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 5\rightarrow 6$.  For each arc we check how much spare capacity it has:
$$
\begin{array}{r|ccccc}
\mbox{arc}&\mbox{total capacity}&&\mbox{current load}&&\mbox{excess capacity}\\
\hline
1\rightarrow 3&9&-&2&=&7\\

The smallest excess capacity is $3$, so that's what we'll add to the flow, which is shown below:

Time for another augmenting path.  This time let's take $1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 4\rightarrow 6$.  The excess capacities of these arcs are $5$, $4$, and $3$, respectively, so the most we can send down this way is $3$.  The updated flow is:

It's getting a little harder to spot augmenting paths now, but there's at least one more: $1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 4\rightarrow 5\rightarrow 6$.  We have

Now we're managing to get $9$ units from the source to the sink.  But, is the best we can do?

\bigskip
{\bf How you know when you're done}
\bigskip

Trying to move stuff from the source to the sink depends very much on the paths from the source to the sink.  It is depends on the ways in which those paths can be cut off.

\begin{definition}
A {\it cut\/} in a network (or just a digraph) is a set of arcs such that if they are removed, there is not path from the source to the sink.
\end{definition}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}

For example, the dashed arcs in our graph below represent a cut since removing them leaves no paths from the source to the sink.  (Note that you are {\it not\/} allowed to go $1\rightarrow 3\rightarrow5\rightarrow4\rightarrow6$, because then you are traversing the $4\rightarrow 6$ arc in the wrong direction.)

We will need to measure how much stuff could flow through all the arcs in a cut:

\begin{definition}
The {\it capacity\/} of a cut is defined to be the sum of the capacities of every arc in the cut.
\end{definition}

So to figure out the capacity of a cut, we want to look at the original capacity graph, {\it not\/} the flow graph we may or may not have just made.  The example cut above, shown on the capacity graph below, has capacity $4+8+2+9=23$.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}

Now we are ready for the big theorem, which will tell us when we are done in the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In every network, the maximum flow equals the minimum capacity of a cut.
\end{theorem}

This theorem was proved in 1956 independently by Ford and Fulkerson and by Feinstein and Shannon.  The proof by Ford and Fulkerson uses their algorithm is a very straight-forward way.  The theorem can also be proved by apply the Duality Theorem from Linear Programming.

The only problem with the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem is that the two quantities it says are equal are both hard to get a handle on.  But, it is nice to know that if you can find a flow and a cut with the same value, you are done.  That is, you have found the best flow possible for that network.

What about our example?  Did we find the best flow possible?  Well, we were able to pump $9$ units from the source to the sink.  However, the cut we found had capacity $23$, so there must either be a better flow or a smaller cut.  Let's keep playing around with the cuts for a while, and see if we can make a better one.

So, we found a flow that transported $9$ units and a cut that had capacity $9$.  By the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem we have found the best flow possible, and we can stop.

And let's suppose that we start the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm by adding the augmenting path $1\rightarrow2\rightarrow3\rightarrow4$, which we can ship $1$ unit down.  Then we get the following flow

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wrinkles}

Stop for a moment and answer these questions: Is this the maximum flow possible?  If not, can you spot an augmenting path that would make it maximum?

To answer the first question you should think of the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.  If we could find a cut of capacity $1$, then this would indeed be the maximum possible flow.  Sadly, there is no cut of capacity $1$.  Then minimum cut we can make has capacity $2$:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{vgraph14}

%\ncline{1,2}{2,3}\naput{1} % 2->4
%\ncline{3,2}{2,3}\naput{1} % 3->4
%\end{psmatrix}
%$$

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wrinkles}

The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem then tells us that there must be a better flow.  Of course, in this example, it's easy to find a better flow, but don't think about that.  The concern right now is: how can we improve the flow we already have?

The answer is that we can add an augmenting path that goes the wrong way down a pipe!  So, we can add the path that goes $1\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 4$.  But how much can we take through this route?

We compute excess capacity like normal for the arcs that we are going the right way on:
$$
\begin{array}{r|ccccc}
\mbox{arc}&\mbox{total capacity}&&\mbox{current load}&&\mbox{excess capacity}\\
\hline
1\rightarrow 3&1&-&0&=&1\\
2\rightarrow 4&1&-&0&=&1
\end{array}
$$

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wrinkles}

For the $3\rightarrow 2$ arc that we are going the wrong way down, the excess capacity is however much is currently flowing down it in the right direction.  So, since we are currently sending $1$ unit down the $2\rightarrow 3$ arc in the right direction (that is, from $2$ to $3$), we can send $1$ unit up this arc in the wrong direction.

Then the other change is that when we update the flow, we add the new amount to the arcs that we went down in the right direction like before, but we {\it subtract\/} the new amount from the arcs that we went down the wrong way.

In this case our new flow is

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wrinkles}

This has now increased our total flow to $2$, and since we already found a cut of capacity $2$, the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem tells us that we are done.

There are two ways to think about why we are allowed to send stuff the wrong way down a pipe.  First, we might just observe that in adding the augmenting path in the manner in which we just did, we did break any of the rules for flows - that is, our new flow still satisfied (\ref{flow1}), (\ref{flow2}), and (\ref{flow3}).

The other way to think about it is that instead of ``sending stuff the wrong way,'' we were really just dropping off stuff on one side of the arc and then telling the previous path to leave it's stuff on the other side of the arc.  In our example, in our initial flow we were pumping $1$ unit from $1$ to $2$ to $3$ to $4$.  When we went to add the new path, what we said to the old path was ``we'll bring one unit from $1$ to $3$, so you can take that to $4$, and hey, would you mind leaving a unit at $2$ so that we can pick it up and take it to $4$?''

%   \begin{frame}[fragile]{Traveling salesman problem}
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item We have a graph of $n$ vertices, and a cost $c_{i,j}$ between each pair of vertices $i, j$. We want to find a cycle through all vertices in the graph so that the sum of the edge costs in the cycle is minimal.
%
%
%        \item This problem is NP-Hard, so there is no known deterministic polynomial time algorithm that solves it
%
%
%        \item Simple to do in $O(n!)$ by going through all permutations of the vertices, but that's too slow if $n > 11$
%
%
%        \item Can we go higher if we use dynamic programming?
