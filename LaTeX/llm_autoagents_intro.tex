\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction to AI Agents}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2024 is expected to be the year of AI agents.
        \item AI agents combine multiple components to solve complex problems.
        \item Shifting from monolithic models to compound AI systems.
        \item Compound AI systems use system design for better problem solving.
        \item AI agents improve with reasoning, acting, and memory components. (ReAct = Reasoning + Acting)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{From Monolithic Models to Compound AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Monolithic models are limited by training data.
        \item Hard to adapt without significant data and resources.
        \item Example: Vacation planning with no personal data access.
        \item Compound AI systems solve this by integrating multiple components.
        \item External databases and tools enhance model responses.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{System Design in Compound AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Systems are modular: combine models, tools, and databases.
        \item Easier to adapt and quicker to solve problems.
        \item Combining models with external components for enhanced output.
        \item Example: Search query integrated with model for better accuracy.
        \item Programmatic control logic guides the response.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Role of Agents in Compound AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agents use large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and planning.
        \item LLMs break down problems into manageable tasks.
        \item Slow thinking (planning) leads to better solutions.
        \item Agents provide flexibility in solving complex tasks.
        \item The agent's role is to manage logic and interact with tools.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Components of LLM Agents}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reasoning: Break down complex problems into steps.
        \item Acting: Use external tools like databases or calculators.
        \item Memory: Store logs and conversation history for personalization.
        \item Tools: External programs that help solve problems (e.g., search, calculators).
        \item Configurations: Adjust agents using frameworks like ReACT.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example: REACT Agent in Action}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item REACT agents think slowly, plan, and act iteratively.
        \item User query feeds into the agent with reasoning instructions.
        \item The agent may call external tools and evaluate the results.
        \item If the result is wrong, the agent revises its plan.
        \item Example: Calculating sunscreen needs for a vacation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Modularity and Complex Problem Solving}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modular AI systems can solve more complex problems.
        \item Example: Planning vacation with weather, sunscreen, and health data.
        \item Agents handle multiple paths to find the best solution.
        \item Compound AI is flexible and adapts to different problem scopes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Agent Autonomy in Problem Solving}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Narrow problems can be solved with fixed, programmatic systems.
        \item Complex tasks require agent autonomy for better flexibility.
        \item Autonomy level depends on task complexity and need for iteration.
        \item Agents are effective for complex, diverse tasks (e.g., GitHub issues).
    \end{itemize}
