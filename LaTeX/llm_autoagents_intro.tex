%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Autonomous AI Agents}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Collaborative approach yields astonishing enhancements in performance and capabilities. Contrasted with using a single AI, such as ChatGPT, in isolation.
    \item Ability to assume distinct roles within a team. Like professionals in various fields.
    \item Each agent contributes specialized expertise to the conversation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Blueprint}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Planning: Reflects on past experiences, offers self-critiques, and breaks down tasks into manageable steps using sub-goal decomposition.
    \item Memory: Utilizes sensory, short-term, and long-term memory for real-time data processing, task-specific information, and retaining knowledge/experiences.
    \item Tools: Equipped with a virtual toolbox, accessing calendars, calculators, search engines, and other resources for versatile problem-solving.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Flow: The Symphony}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Task Decomposition % : Breaks down tasks into smaller, more manageable components for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.
    \item Model (LLM) Selection % : Chooses the most suitable Large Language Model (LLM) for the task to align actions with desired outcomes.
    \item Task Execution leveraging planning, memory, and tools.
    \item Response Generation % : Generates contextually relevant and accurate responses, be it drafting a report, answering questions, or making decisions.
  \end{itemize}
