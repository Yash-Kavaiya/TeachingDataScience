\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Backing up music files}
\begin{itemize}
\item Say, you have hundreds of mp3s scattered all over the folders on your hard disk.
\item Wish to get them in a folder and zip them up for backup
%\item If the files in the playlist have some leading zeros like song001.mp3, song002.mp3, song003.mp3, those need to be removed.
\end{itemize}
Is there any automatic program you have used to do so?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Copying files}
\begin{itemize}
\item $shutil$ (or shell utilities) module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs
\item use $shutil.make\_archive$. It supports both zip and tar formats.
\end{itemize}

All these lines can be typed on command line Python Shell as well.


Only some bits are shown here:
\begin{lstlisting}
import glob, shutil 
src_dir = '/home/my/Downloads/'
dest_dir = '/home/my/Music/Songs/'

for f in glob.iglob(src_dir +'**/*.cmp3', recursive=True):
    shutil.copy(f, dest_dir)
    
shutil.make_archive(`mysongs.zip', 'zip', dest_dir)
\end{lstlisting}
