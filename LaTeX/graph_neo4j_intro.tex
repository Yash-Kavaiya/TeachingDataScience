  \begin{block}{Graph Definition}
    A graph $G$ is an ordered pair $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges connecting the vertices.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Directed vs. undirected graphs
    \item Nodes (vertices) and relationships (edges)
    \item Properties and labels
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Graph Components}

\begin{itemize}
\item Node (Vertex): A must data element for constructing a graph
\item Relationship (Edge) : Link between two nodes, can have direction and type.
\item Label: Node category/type such as PERSON, ORG, etc. One node can have many types.
\item Properties: Attributes or fields in Nodes or Edges, eg. A node can have Label PERSON and Property such as ``name: Jane''
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Graph-Edge Types}

\begin{itemize}
\item Undirected graph: edges are bidirectional, e.g. Michale is brother of John, necessarily means that John is brother of Michale.
\item Directed graph: edges have one direction, e.g. A likes B does not necessarily mean that B likes A.
\item Weighted graph: edges have weights, e.g. connection from city A to city B via road R1 will have wright, say, 8, due to high traffic, but via road R2, may have weight 2, due to lower traffic.
