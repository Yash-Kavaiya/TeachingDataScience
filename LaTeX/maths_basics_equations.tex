 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Algebra}
\begin{itemize}
\item Equation 'equates' two expressions. E.g. $3x+4=10$
\item We solve equations for unknowns such as $x$
\item $x$ in the equation above have coefficient $3$.
\item Others like $4$ and $10$ are constants.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Equations}
 $3x+4=10$
\begin{itemize}
\item To Solve, we isolate $x$ on one side by operations.
\item $3x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4$
\item Although a short hand way is just to transfer $4$ from one side to other and changing the sign.
\item $3x = 6$
\item In case of coefficients, you divide after crossing the $=$
\item $3x/3 = 6/3$
\item $x = 2$
\item To test, plug $x=2$, back in the original equation and see if both sides 'equate'.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Distributive Property}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item $3(x+2)=18$ is same as $3x + 6 = 18$
\item Intuitively we multiply everything from outside, as if its a coefficient.
\item Now instead of just 3 I have another expression to multiply $(3x + 3)(x+2) = 18$
\item Same distributive property works?
\end{itemize}

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Two Variables}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item $2y - 4x = 2$
\item How to solve?
\item Can we solve?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Two Variables}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item $2y - 4x = 2$
\item Isolate $y$ first 
\item $2y = 2 + 4x$
\item $y = 1 + 2x$
\item Thats y's definition in terms of x.
\item For any x, y can be calculated.
\item x, y if plotted form a line, thus the original equation is called as Linear Equation.
\end{itemize}

Make one of the equations (say, first) as NEGATIVE of the other in one variable, so that their addition cancels it out, leaving only one variable. Easy to find solution. Put that value back in the original equation, to get the other variable value.
