\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Progression}

Models for prediction:

\begin{itemize}
\item On data, derive features, put statistical techniques like regression. One model per task. That's Machine Learning.
\item Feed raw data, employ neural networks. One model per task. That's Deep Learning.
\item Use Text data, get embeddings, use ML/DL, say for classification. One model per task. That's Natural Language Processing.
\item Train neural network on large corpus, store weights and architecture, then add final layers for say classification on custom data+labels. That's Pretrained model. One model, many tasks.
\item Train Large Language Model, just supply instructions on what to do, works. One model many tasks. Zero-shot, few-shots.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary of Prompt Engineering}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition of Prompts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Prompts are initial text inputs provided to a model.
      \item Used by the model to generate responses or accomplish tasks.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Role of Prompts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sets of instructions for AI or chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT).
      \item Applied in various tasks, including summarization, arithmetic problem-solving, and question-answering.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Objective of Prompt Engineering}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Goal: Refine prompts to enhance model accuracy and relevance in outputs.
      \item Central to improving the performance of language models.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Prevalent Prompt Types}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Various prompt types exist, with a focus on two widely used methodologies:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Zero-shot prompting}
          \item \textbf{Few-shot prompting}
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Interaction Guidelines: Avoid Misuses}

\begin{itemize}
\item Factual Accuracy: Interactions must be free from factual inaccuracies that can be challenged by social media or journalists.
\item Negative Debates: Avoid discussing topics that fuel negative or concerning online debates, such as AI sentience, AI in education, AI-driven job displacements, and politically divisive issues.
\item Minors' Involvement: Do not include use cases specifically targeting or involving individuals under 18 years old.
\item Sensitivity and Misinformation: Prevent the inclusion of sensitive, misleading, or hazardous responses.
\item Search and Google Assistant: Interactions that require basic, straightforward answers are better suited for Search or Google Assistant.
\item Financial/Legal/Medical Advice: Refrain from providing advice related to financial matters, legal issues, or medical concerns.
\item Brand Names and Trademarks: Avoid mentioning specific brand names, trademarks, or public figures (except historical figures).
\item No Reviews or Tweets: Do not request reviews of restaurants, businesses, or tweets to minimize the risk of associating with bots.
\item Avoid Personification: Refrain from personifying the product or brand and from encouraging users to address Bard by name.

Prompt Engineering is an Iterative Process:

\begin{itemize}
\item Try something
\item Analyze where the results do not match the expectations
\item Clarify instructions, gives examples, specify output format, specify constraints, etc
\item Test on a batch of known results.
\end{itemize}
