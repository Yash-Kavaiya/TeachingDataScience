\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{re}
We can access the machinery of regular expressions through its
\lstinline{re} module.  Let's see what \lstinline{re} provides:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import re
>>> dir(re)
['DOTALL', 'I', 'IGNORECASE', 'L', 'LOCALE', 'M', 'MULTILINE', 
'S', 'U', 'UNICODE', 'VERBOSE', 'X', '__all__', '__builtins__',
'__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', 'compile', 'engine', 'error',
'escape', 'findall', 'match', 'purge', 'search', 'split', 'sub',
'subn', 'template']
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{re}
 A
regular expression pattern itself is a string.  For example, the
string "alpha beta" is a pattern that, when given any string that contains ``alpha beta''
anywhere in it, will match successfully.  Nothing too exciting. But how about: "a+"
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{re}
\begin{itemize}
\item Here, the \lstinline-+- doesn't literally stand for the plus character:
instead, it attaches a meaning to the character right before it.  This
particular example, as a regular expression, means ``One or more
\texttt{a}'s''.  
\item So if we're looking for repetition, using \lstinline-+-
works very well.  
\item In regular expression terms, \lstinline-+- is a
metacharacter, and there are quite a few of them. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
"a+"
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{re}
We can list out a
few others:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline+.+ matches any single character
\item \lstinline+*+ matches zero or more of the last character
\item \lstinline+?+ matches zero or one of the last character
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Starting to use}

\begin{itemize}
\item re.search(expr,s) checks a string s for an occurrence of a substring which matches the regular expression expr.
\item If a match has been possible, we get a so-called match object as a result, otherwise the value will be None.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import re
>>> x = re.search("cat","A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
>>> print(x)
<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x7fd4bf238238>
>>> x = re.search("cow","A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
>>> print(x)
None
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Starting to use}
We get an SRE object returned, which is taken as a True value, and None, which is the return value if it doesn't match, is taken as False:

\begin{itemize}
\item re.search(expr,s) checks a string s for an occurrence of a substring which matches the regular expression expr.
\item If a match has been possible, we get a so-called match object as a result, otherwise the value will be None.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> if re.search("cat","A cat and a rat can't be friends."):
...     print("Some kind of cat has been found :-)")
... else:
...     print("No cat has been found :-)")
... 
Some kind of cat has been found :-)
>>> if re.search("cow","A cat and a rat can't be friends."):
...     print("Cats and Rats and a cow.")
... else:
...     print("No cow around.")
... 
No cow around.

 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Motivating regular expressions}

\textbf{Regular expressions} help describe complex patterns of words

Examples:

\begin{itemize}

 \item In a large document I want to find addresses with a zip code
   starting with 411 (around Pune, India)
\item Find all gmail addresses occurring in a long text
\end{itemize}

It would be nice to have a compact way of
    representing all of these options.

 Anything where you have to match a complex pattern so-called
     \textbf{regular expressions} are useful.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Regular expressions: Tools that use them}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A variety of unix tools (grep, sed, \ldots), editors (emacs,
    jEdit, \ldots), and programming languages (perl, python, Java, \ldots)
    incorporate regular expressions.

  \item Implementations are very efficient so that large text files
    can be searched quickly
\item The various tools differ w.r.t. the exact syntax of the regular
expressions they allow, but knowledge of one transfers
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Any Character}

\begin{itemize}
\item Say, we are inetersted in any word which ends with "at".
\item The syntax of regular expressions supplies a metacharacter ".", which is used like a placeholder for "any character". 
\item The regular expression of our example can be written like this: 
\item This RE matches three letter words, isolated by blanks, which end in "at". Now we get words like "rat", "cat", "bat", "eat", "sat" and many others. 
\item But what, if the text contains "words" like "@at" or "3at"? These words match as well and this means that we have created over matching again. 
\item Will see how to avoid it, later.
\end{itemize}


\begin{lstlisting}
r" .at " 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Starting to use}
\begin{itemize}
\item There's something somewhat new here that we haven't seen yet ---
what's that ``\texttt{r}'' in front of the quotes?  
\item  In Python, it's
called a ``raw'' string.  Basically, it turns off the special meaning
of the backslash, so that the \lstinline+\+ literally means backslash.
\item We'll see raw strings a lot, especially with regular expressions that
use a lot of backslashes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{. - A period}
Matches any single character except newline character. The group() function returns the string matched by the re. (more on it, later)

\begin{lstlisting}
re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()

'Cookie'
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Character Classes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Square brackets, "[" and "]", are used to include a character class. [xyz] means e.g. either an "x", an "y" or a "z". 
\item Let's look at a more practical example: \lstinline|r"M[ae][iy]er"|
\item This is a regular expression, which matches a surname which is quite common in German. 
\item A name with the same pronunciation and four different spellings: Maier, Mayer, Meier, Meyer 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Character Classes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of a choice between two characters, we often need a choice between larger character classes. 
\item We might need e.g. a class of letters between "a" and "e" or between "0" and "5"
\item To manage such character classes the syntax of regular expressions supplies a metacharacter "-". [a-e] a simplified writing for [abcde] or [0-5] denotes [012345]. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Character Classes}

\begin{itemize}
\item The only other special character inside square brackets (character class choice) is the caret "\^".
\item  If it is used directly after an opening sqare bracket, it negates the choice. [\^0-9] denotes the choice "any character but a digit". 
\item The position of the caret within the square brackets is crucial. If it is not positioned as the first character following the opening square bracket, it has no special meaning. 
\item [\^abc] means anything but an "a", "b" or "c" 
\item [a\^bc] means an "a", "b", "c" or a "\^". 
\end{itemize}

When we find ourselves using a certain regular expression over and
over, we can cache a regular expression by \lstinline{compile()}ing it: \lstinline|>>> myre = re.compile(r"http://[\w\.-]+\.?(?![\w.-])")|
What we get back is a regular expression object that remembers the
pattern it uses to search for things.  Let's see it in action.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> myre.search('all your http are belong to us')     ## no match

\item \lstinline{match()} and \lstinline|search()| return \lstinline|None| if no match
can be found.  
\item If they're successful, a \lstinline|MatchObject| instance is
returned, containing information about the match: where it starts and
ends, the substring it matched, and more.

 Now you can query the \lstinline|MatchObject| for information about the
matching string.  \lstinline|MatchObject| instances also have several
methods and attributes; the most important ones are:
\begin{tabular}{c|l}
code & Method/Attribute  Purpose \\
  \lstinline|group()| & {Return the string matched by the RE}\\
  \lstinline|start()| &{Return the starting position of the match}\\
  \lstinline|end()|&{Return the ending position of the match}\\
  \lstinline|span()|&{Return a tuple containing the (start, end)}\\
\end{tabular}

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item A \textbf{corpus} is a collection of text.
%   \item Corpora with the works of various writers, newspaper texts,
%     etc. have been collected and electronically encoded.
%   \item Corpora can be quite large

%   \item The \href{http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/}{British National
%       Corpus} is a 100 million word collection representing a wide
%     cross-section of current written and spoken British English.
    
%   \item Another example is the
%     \href{http://people.csail.mit.edu/people/koehn/publications/europarl/}{European
%       Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus 1996--2003}.

%%Various online web interfaces allow RE queries
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%
%%% \item Both the BNC and the European Parliament corpus can be searched
%%%   using on-line web-forms.
%%
%%% \item Both of the web forms allow \textbf{regular expressions} for
%%%   advanced searching.
%%    
%%\item To provide efficient searching in large corpora, in these search
%%  engines regular expressions over characters are often limited to
%%  single tokens (i.e. generally words)
%%
%%\item BNC:
%%  \begin{itemize}
%%  \item web form: \url{http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/using/index.xml?ID=simple}
%%    %\url{http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/lookup.html}
%%    % \url{http://thetis.bl.uk/lookup.html} is the same machine
%%  \item regular expressions are enclosed in \texttt{\{ \}}
%%  \end{itemize}
%%
%%% \item European Parliament Corpus:
%%%   \begin{itemize}
%%%   \item web form:
%%%     \url{http://logos.uio.no/cgi-bin/opus/opuscqp.pl?corpus=EUROPARL;lang=en}
%%%   \item in the simplest case, regular expressions are encosed in
%%%     \texttt{" "}
%%%   \end{itemize}
%%\item Internet corpora:
%%  \begin{itemize}
%%  \item \url{http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html}
%%  \item See notes on query language:
