\begin{itemize}
\item An Intuitive Definition: Prompt is a cue given to the pre-trained language model to allow it
better understand humanâ€™s questions
\item More Technical Definition: Prompt is the technique of making better use of the knowledge from
the pre-trained model by adding additional texts to the input.
\item Purpose: making better use of the knowledge
\item Method: adding additional texts to the input
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item While typing SMS, have you seen it suggests next word?
% \item While typing email, have you seen next few words are suggested?
% \item How does it suggest? (suggestions are not random, right?)
% \item In the past, for ``Lets go for a \ldots', if you have typed 'coffee' 15 times, 'movie' say 4 times, then it learns that. Machine/Statistical Learning.
% \item Next time, when you type ``Lets go for a '', what will be suggested? why?
% \item This is called Language Model. Predicting the next word. When done continuously, one after other, it spits sentence, called Generative Model.

Models for prediction:

\begin{itemize}
\item On data, derive features, put statistical techniques like regression. One model per task. That's Machine Learning.
\item Feed raw data, employ neural networks. One model per task. That's Deep Learning.
\item Use Text data, get embeddings, use ML/DL, say for classification. One model per task. That's Natural Language Processing.
\item Train neural network on large corpus, store weights and architecture, then add final layers for say classification on custom data+labels. That's Pretrained model. One model, many tasks.
\item Train Large Language Model, just supply instructions on what to do, works. One model many tasks. Zero-shot, few-shots.
