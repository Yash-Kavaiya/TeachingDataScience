%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Choosing the Right Memory}

Memory Selection Criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Conversation Length}: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Short interactions: Buffer Memory
    \item Limited context needed: Buffer Window Memory
    \item Complex, entity-rich conversations: Entity/Knowledge Graph Memory
    \item Large, searchable conversation history: Vector Store Memory
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Computational Resources}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Limited resources: Buffer or Buffer Window Memory
    \item More computational power: Knowledge Graph or Vector Store Memory
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Specific Requirements}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Track specific entities: Entity Memory
    \item Semantic context retrieval: Vector Store Memory
    \item Simple context tracking: Basic Buffer Memory
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Need}

\begin{itemize}
    \item LangChain's ConversationChain has a simple type of memory.
    \item The memory remembers all previous inputs/outputs and adds them to the context passed.
    \item This memory can be considered a type of short-term memory.
    \item Example: How to use ConversationChain with short-term memory.
    \item It can remember the initial messages even after 3 questions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain

llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003", temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)

output = conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")

print(output)

> Entering new ConversationChain chain...

Prompt after formatting:

The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:

> Finished chain.

Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{ConversationBufferMemory}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ConversationChain uses the ConversationBufferMemory class by default to store a history of messages.
    \item This memory saves previous conversations in the form of variables.
    \item The class accepts the return\_messages argument, which is useful for dealing with chat models.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi there!"}, {"output": "Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"})

print( memory.load_memory_variables({}) )

>>{'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi there!', additional_kwargs={}, example=False),
  AIMessage(content="Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{ConversationBufferMemory}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This memory implementation stores the entire conversation history as a single string.
    \item Advantages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maintains a complete record of the conversation.
        \item Straightforward to implement and use.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Disadvantages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Less efficient as the conversation grows longer.
        \item May lead to excessive repetition if the conversation history is too long for the model's token limit.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{ConversationBufferMemory (Contd.)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the model's token limit is surpassed, the buffer gets truncated to fit within the limit.
    \item Older interactions may be removed from the buffer to accommodate newer ones.
    \item This truncation may cause the conversation context to lose some information.
    \item To avoid surpassing the token limit:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Monitor the token count in the buffer.
        \item Manage the conversation accordingly, e.g., shorten input texts or remove less relevant parts.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{ConversationBufferWindowMemory}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This class limits memory size by keeping a list of the most recent K interactions.
    \item Maintains a sliding window of recent interactions to prevent the buffer from growing too large.
    \item Advantages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stores a fixed number of recent messages, making it more efficient than ConversationBufferMemory.
        \item Reduces the risk of exceeding the model's token limit.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{ConversationBufferWindowMemory (Contd.)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Disadvantage:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Does not maintain the complete conversation history.
        \item Chatbot might lose context if essential information falls outside the fixed window of messages.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Possible to retrieve specific interactions from ConversationBufferWindowMemory.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{ConversationSummaryMemory}
ConversationSummaryBufferMemory is a memory management strategy that combines the ideas of keeping a buffer of recent interactions in memory and compiling old interactions into a summary. It extracts key information from previous interactions and condenses it into a shorter, more manageable format. 
\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Condensing conversation information.
    \item Reducing the number of tokens required to store the conversation history.
    \item Flexibility in returning history as a list of messages or a plain text summary.
    \item Direct summary prediction with \texttt{predict\_new\_summary} method.
    \item Provides more control over the summarization process.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loss of information in the summary.
    \item Possible omission of important details from the conversation.
    \item Increased complexity compared to simpler memory types like ConversationBufferMemory.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Memory}

\begin{itemize}
\item OpenAI's API as the most powerful LLM API today
\item Non-stateful nature of the API requires passing back necessary context for each request
\item Light weight options for storing message history (Python list, text file) but not scalable
\item Spin up a vector database for embeddings, but requires additional work
\item Langchain's memory module for automatic message history storage
\item Plug and play access to multiple data stores
\item Reduction of friction in creating chatbots, for example
\item Langchain's support for 10 different database integrations
\item Increasing options outside Langchain for managing chat history and truncation
\item Truncation process: narrowing down message history to fit within context window
\item Different approaches to truncation with no perfect solution
\item Importance of embeddings and memory in Langchain for managing chat history.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Recap and Strategies}

\textbf{Strategies to Manage Token Limit:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove oldest messages once token count is reached.
    \item Limit conversation duration to max token length or turns.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ConversationBufferWindowMemory Method:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintains fixed-size buffer window of most recent tokens.
    \item Suitable for remembering recent interactions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ConversationSummaryBufferMemory Approach:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combines features of ConversationSummaryMemory and ConversationBufferWindowMemory.
    \item Summarizes earliest interactions while maintaining recent tokens.
    \item Allows model to remember both distant and recent interactions.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Recap and Strategies (Contd.)}

\textbf{Handling Token Limit:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keep track of token count and send prompt within the limit.
    \item Maximum token limit for GPT-3.5-turbo is 4096 tokens.
    \item Split input text into smaller chunks and process separately.
    \item Use batch processing to work with large texts.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removing a message from input causes model to lose knowledge of it.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remember:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilize OpenAI's tiktoken library for efficient token counting.

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple string \lstinline|my_text = "What day comes after Friday?"|
\item For the models that handle conversations, chat message type input is needed. There are three message types to label who the sender is: system (Role), human (Prompt), and assistant (AI) for response.
\item Some LLM models accept a document as their input. A document not only includes the page content but also some meta-data such as the source and creation time.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Import the \texttt{OpenAICopy} wrapper from \texttt{langchain.llmsCopy} module.
        \item Initialize with the desired model name and any additional arguments (e.g., high temperature for more randomness).
        \item Create a \texttt{PromptTemplateCopy} to format the input for the model.
        \item Define an \texttt{LLMChainCopy} to combine the model and prompt.
        \item Run the chain with desired input using \texttt{.run()Copy}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Remember to set your OpenAI key in the “OPENAI\_API\_KEY” environment variable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chat Models like ChatGPT are popular in LangChain for their ability to incorporate GPT-3 or GPT-4 at their core.
    \item They use LLMs as their underlying technology but have more structured APIs.
    \item Chat Models take a list of messages as input and return an \texttt{AIMessageCopy}.
    \item They remember previous exchanges with the user to generate relevant responses and benefit from reinforcement learning from human feedback.
    \item However, they may have limitations in reasoning and require careful handling to avoid inappropriate content.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{API Differences and Message Types}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In LangChain, three main message types are used when interacting with chat models:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{SystemMessageCopy}: Provides initial instructions or context for the AI model. Not user inputs but guidelines for the AI.
        \item \texttt{HumanMessageCopy}: Comes from the user and represents their input. The AI model is expected to respond to these messages.
        \item \texttt{AIMessageCopy}: Sent from the AI's perspective, representing its responses to human input.
    \end{itemize}
    \item You can customize the human prefix (e.g., "User") and AI prefix (e.g., "AI Assistant" or "AI") in the conversation summary to change how input and responses are represented.
    \item An example of using \texttt{ChatOpenAI} with a \texttt{HumanMessageCopy}: Creating a chatbot for English to French translation, using multiple message types to enhance model comprehension.

\item You can pass a static prompt to a model and get a result, but it will be boring. 
\item For a model to provide a relevant output dynamically based on the user and the context, you need a smarter way to construct the prompt.
\item With the prompt template class, you can create a prompt that includes variables, so the content of a template can be super flexible, which can even pull data from external sources.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A chain in LangChain is an end-to-end wrapper around multiple components.
    \item It combines individual components in a specific sequence to accomplish a common use case.
    \item The most commonly used type of chain is the LLMChain.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consists of a PromptTemplate, a model (LLM or ChatModel), and an optional output parser.
    \end{itemize}
    \item LLMChain's working process:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Takes (multiple) input variables.
        \item Formats the input variables into a prompt using the PromptTemplate.
        \item Passes the formatted prompt to the model (LLM or ChatModel).
        \item If provided, uses the OutputParser to parse the LLM's output into a final format.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Agents are high-level components in LangChain that utilize Language Models (LLMs) to make decisions about actions.
    \item Actions can involve using a tool and observing its output or returning it to the user.
    \item Tools are functions that perform specific duties like Google Search, database lookups, or Python REPL.
    \item Agents operate by making decisions, taking actions, observing outputs, and repeating until a task is completed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Types of Agents in LangChain}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{zero-shot-react-description} agent: Uses ReAct framework to decide which tool to employ based on the tool's description. Requires a description for each tool.
    \item The \textbf{react-docstore} agent: Engages with a docstore through ReAct framework. Needs a Search tool and a Lookup tool. Searches for a document and looks up a term in the most recent document found.
    \item The \textbf{self-ask-with-search} agent: Employs a single tool named Intermediate Answer to look up factual responses to queries. Similar to the original self-ask with the search paper, where a Google search API was provided as the tool.
    \item The \textbf{conversational-react-description} agent: Designed for conversational situations. Uses ReAct framework to select a tool and utilizes memory to remember past conversation interactions.

    \item To use Google Search via API, set the environment variables \texttt{GOOGLE\_API\_KEY} and \texttt{GOOGLE\_CSE\_ID}. Refer to the guide for obtaining them.
    \item Import the necessary modules:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{langchain.llms.OpenAI}: Create an instance of the OpenAI language model for human-like text generation.
        \item \texttt{langchain.agents.load\_tools}: Load a list of tools that an AI agent can use.

        \item \texttt{name}: A unique identifier for the tool. (e.g., "google-search")
        \item \texttt{func}: The function executed when the tool is called. (e.g., \texttt{search.run()})
        \item \texttt{description}: A brief explanation of the tool's purpose. (e.g., answering questions about current events using Google)

\begin{itemize}
\item Despite being quite powerful, LLMs have some limitations: they lack contextual information (e.g., access to specific knowledge not contained in training data), they can become outdated quickly (e.g., GPT-4 was trained on data before September 2021), and they are bad at math.
\item we need to give them access to supplementary tools such as search (e.g., Google Search), calculators (e.g., Python REPL or Wolfram Alpha), and lookups (e.g., Wikipedia).
\item Additionally, we need agents that make decisions about which tools to use to accomplish a task based on the LLM’s output.

\frametitle{Agents in LangChain}

Agents in LangChain play a crucial role in decision-making and task execution based on user input. There are two primary categories of agents:

\textbf{1. Action Agents:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine and execute a single action.
    \item Suitable for straightforward tasks.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Plan-and-Execute Agents:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Devise a plan with multiple actions.
    \item Execute actions sequentially.
    \item Ideal for complex or long-running tasks with long-term objectives.
    \item May lead to more calls and higher latency.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Action Agents + Plan-and-Execute Agents:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Action Agents manage execution for Plan-and-Execute Agents.
    \item Utilize both strengths for optimal performance.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Agents and Tools in LangChain}

\textbf{Agents:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Employ language models as reasoning mechanisms.
    \item Linked with key elements called \textit{tools}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tools:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Connect language models with data sources (e.g., search engines, APIs).
    \item Retrieve current data as context for the prompt.
    \item Execute actions and observe results, influencing the model's decision-making process.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{LLMs as Content Generators and Reasoning Engines}

\textbf{Content Generator:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language model creates content solely from its internal knowledge base.
    \item Leads to highly creative outputs.
    \item May produce unverified information or 'hallucinations.'
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reasoning Engine:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acts as an information manager rather than a creator.
    \item Gathers relevant, accurate information using external tools.
    \item Draws from similar resources to extract and summarize relevant details.
