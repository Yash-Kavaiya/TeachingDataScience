        \item Components:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Matrix Profile (series of distances of the closest neighbor). The  $i^{th}$   element  in  the  matrix  profile  $P$  indicates  the  Euclidean  distance  from subsequence $T_{i,m}$  to its nearest neighbor in time series $T$. However, it does not indicate the  location  of  that  nearest  neighbor.  This  information  is  recorded  in  a  companion data structure called the matrix profile index.
                \item Matrix Profile Index (series of indices of the closest neighbor)
            \end{itemize}
        \item Based on z-normalized Euclidean distance
