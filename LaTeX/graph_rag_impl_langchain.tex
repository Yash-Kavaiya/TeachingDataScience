\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Graph RAG?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Enhances traditional RAG by incorporating knowledge graphs.
    \item Moves beyond vector similarity to structured entity relationships.
    \item Enables LLMs to reason over graph-based data structures.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Installation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Install required packages:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
pip install --upgrade --quiet \
  langchain langchain-community \
  langchain-core langchain-experimental \
  networkx json-repair
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Importing Modules}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Import essential modules:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
from langchain_experimental.graph_transformers import LLMGraphTransformer
from langchain_experimental.graphs import GraphQAChain
from langchain_community.graphs.networkx_graph import NetworkxEntityGraph
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAI
import google.generativeai as genai
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Setting Up the LLM}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize the LLM (e.g., Google Generative AI):
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
  GOOGLE_API_KEY = ''
  genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
llm = GoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro",api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Preparing the Text}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Load and prepare the input text:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
text = "Marie Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist..."
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Transforming Text to Graph Documents}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Convert text into graph documents:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm)
graph_documents = transformer.convert_to_graph_documents([text])
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Specifying Entities and Relationships}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Define entities and relationships to extract:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
entities = ["Person", "Country", "Organization"]
relationships = ["nationality", "located_in", "worked_at", "spouse", "mother"]
graph_documents_filtered = transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(
    [text], 
    entities=entities, 
    relationships=relationships
)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Creating the Graph Object}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize the graph and add nodes and edges:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
graph = NetworkxEntityGraph()
for doc in graph_documents_filtered:
    for node in doc.nodes:
        graph.add_node(node)
    for edge in doc.edges:
        graph.add_edge(edge.source, edge.target, edge.type)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Performing Graph-Based QA}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize the Graph QA chain and ask questions:
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
qa_chain = GraphQAChain.from_llm(llm=llm, graph=graph)
response = qa_chain.run("Tell me about Marie Curie")
print(response)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Graph RAG integrates structured knowledge into LLM responses.
    \item Enhances the depth and accuracy of information retrieval.
    \item Suitable for complex, relationship-rich data domains.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
