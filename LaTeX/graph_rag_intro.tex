\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why Graph RAG?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Language models struggle with factual accuracy and real-world knowledge.
        \item Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy using external text data.
        \item Traditional RAG has limitations in context understanding and scalability.
        \item GraphRAG leverages knowledge graphs for better retrieval and response generation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Limitations of Traditional RAG}
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Answer has to be in the chunk fully, cannot be across the chunks.
		\item Cannot have multiple chunks compose the final answer.
        \item Documents are treated as isolated entities.
        \item Lacks deep semantic understanding as multi-hop answers
        \item Slower retrieval with increasing data volume.
        \item Lacks global context over the entire data corpus.
        \item Inefficient for complex reasoning across multiple documents.
        \item Hard to trace the source of retrieved information.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How GraphRAG Solves the Problem}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GraphRAG combines graph structures with vector search.
        \item Traverses multi-hop connections to infer relationships.
        \item Offers more reliable responses than vector-only RAG.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Different Approaches}


	\begin{itemize}
	\item English Query is converted to GraphQL or Cypher query then calls GraphDB to fetch the context/answers. Uses few-shots or specialized parsers or fine-tuned LLMs for the conversion (Neo4j way). 
	\item Knowledge Graph is indexed, then English query then sent to index (which fetches, relevant triplets, also node's data), , KG may be created by LLM Graph Transformer and put in NetworkX object, you can populate this externally as well. (Langchain/Llamaindex way)
	\item From documents, populates the Knowledge Graph first, indexes it, then brings the relevant context from the index (Microsoft way)
	\item Contextual Subgraph/Path-based Retrieval Approach: Extracts reasoning paths or connected subgraphs for the input query (mostly academic research)
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example: Medical Query Challenge}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Query: How does Medication A in Patient Record 1 affect Condition B in Patient Record 2?
        \item LLM needs to infer relationships across multiple records.
        \item Standard RAG struggles with such complex dependencies.
        \item Scaling this to millions of patient records is infeasible.
    \end{itemize}
