\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vector Multiplication}

Vector Multiplication is slightly complicated that plain Vector Addition. 

There are a few types of it.

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar into Vector resulting in a vector: e.g. You have a list (a vector) of people's income. Tax rate is 15\%. How do you get a list of Tax amounts?
\item Vector into Vector resulting in a scalar: e.g. You have different amounts of foreign currencies. You know each ones conversion-to-INR rate. How do you compute total INRs you have?
\item Vector into Vector resulting in a vector: e.g. Area of a parallelogram with a right hand rule direction.

\item $w_1 = ||\vec{w}||cos\theta$, so $\theta = cos^{-1}(\frac{w_1}{||\vec{w}||})$
\item Now, dot product is given as $\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} = v_1.w_1 + 0.w_2 = v_1.w_1$
\item Putting value of $w_1$, eqn becomes $= v_1.||\vec{w}||cos\theta = ||\vec{v}||||\vec{w}||cos\theta$

Suppose that $\vec{u}, \vec{v}\in \mathbb R^n$.  We define the
 \textbf{inner product} or \textbf{dot procuct} or $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ as
 $$
 u\cdot v = u^tv=\sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i.
 $$


\textbf{Example}
$$
 \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1\\2\\3 \end{array}\right] \cdot   \left[\begin{array}{r} -1\\-2\\1 \end{array}\right] =
 (1)(-1) + (2)(-2) + (3)(1) = -2.

% \begin{itemize}
 % \item $\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v} = \vec{v} \cdot \vec{u}$.
% \item $(\vec{u} + \vec{v})\cdot \vec{w} = \vec{u}\cdot \vec{w}

% \item $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{u} \geq 0$ and $\vec{u}\cdot \vec{u} = 0$ 
% if and only if $\vec{u} = \vec{0}$.

% +c_p\vec{u}_p\cdot \vec{w}$.
% \end{itemize}
 

% \textbf{Definition}[Length]
% The {\em length} (or {\em norm})  of $\vec{v}$ is the non-negative scalar $\|\vec{v}\|$ 
% defined by 
% \[
 % \| \vec{v} \| = \sqrt{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}} =
% \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 +\dots + v_n^2} \ \text{ and } \ \|\vec{v} \|^2 = 
% \vec{v}\cdot \vec{v}.
 % \]

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Note}
 % This definition is chosen so that the Pythagorean theorem holds (that is, in two 
% dimensions the length $c$ of the vector which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle 
% with horizontal length $a$ and vertical height $b$ satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. 
 

% \textbf{Facts}
% \begin{itemize}
 % \item For any scalar $c$, $\| c\vec{v}\| = |c| \ \|\vec{v}\|$.  
 % \item A vector of length 1 is called a \textbf{unit vector}.  
 % \item  If $\vec{v}\neq \vec{0}$ then $\frac{1}{\| \vec{v} \|} \vec{v}$ 
% is a unit vector and is in the same direction as $\vec{v}$.   
 % \item  The above process is called normalizing.

% \textbf{Definition}
 % Suppose $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \dots \vec{v}_p \in \mathbb R^n$.
 % We define 
 % \[
  % \mbox{Span}(\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \dots ,\vec{v}_p) =
 % \left\{
 % c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \dots c_p \vec{v}_p: c_1, c_2, \dots , c_p \in \mathbb R 
 % \right\}
 % \]    
 % That is, Span$(\vec{v}_1, \dots , \vec{v}_p)$ is the set of all linear combinations
% of $\vec{v}_1, \dots , \vec{v}_p$.

% \textbf{Note}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The span of $\vec{0}$ in $\mathbb R^2$ or $\mathbb R^3$ is the single point $\vec{0}$.
% \item The span of a single non-zero vector in $\mathbb R^2$ or $\mathbb R^3$ is a line through $\vec{0}$.
% \item The span of two non-zero vectors in $\mathbb R^3$ is either a plane through $\vec{0}$ or, if one
% vector is a scalar multiple of the other, a line through $\vec{0}$.
% \end{itemize}


% \textbf{Exercise}
% Let $\vec{v}_1 = \left[\begin{array}{r}1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]$, 
% $\vec{v}_2 = \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 5 \\ -3 \end{array}\right]$ and 
% $\vec{b} = \left[\begin{array}{r} -9 \\ -30 \\ 31 \end{array}\right]$.
% Span$(\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2)$ is a plane in $\mathbb R^3$  Is $\vec{b}$ in that plane?
