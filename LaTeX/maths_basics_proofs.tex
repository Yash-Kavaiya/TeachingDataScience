 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is a proposition?}
A statement that is either true or false.

\begin{itemize}
\item $2+2 = 4$, every odd number is a prime, there are no even primes other than 2;

\item $\forall a,b \in \RingNat, \exists c \in \RingNat: a^2 + b^2 = c$;



$\forall:$ for all, \\
$\exists:$ there exists, \\
$\in, \notin:$ contained in, and not contained in\\

$\RingNat:$ the set of natural numbers,\\
 $\RingInt:$ the set of integers,\\ 
 $\RingRat:$ the set of rationals,\\ 
 $\RingPosInt:$ the set of positive integers,\\
 $\RingReal:$ the set of reals\\
 


\item $\forall a,b \in \RingNat, \exists c \in \RingNat: a^2 - b^2 = c$;


\item $\forall a,b \in \RingNat, \exists c \in \RingInt: a^2 - b^2 = c$;

\begin{theorem}
If $0 \leq x \leq 2,$ then $-x^3+4x+1 > 0$
\end{theorem}

*(scratchpad)*

\begin{proof}
As $-x^3+4x = x(4-x^2)$, which is in fact $x(2-x)(2+x)$, the quantity is 
\textbf{positive} 
non-negative for $0\leq x \leq 2$.
Adding $1$ to a non-negative quantity makes it positive. Therefore, the above theorem.

\begin{theorem}
If $n$ is a composite integer, then $n$ has a prime divisor less than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
As $n$ is a composite, $\exists x,y \in \RingNat, x,y < n:$ $n =xy$. If $x > \sqrt{n}$ and $y > \sqrt{n}$ then
$xy > n$. Therefore, one of $x$ or $y$ is less than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$. Say $x$ is smaller than $\sqrt{n}$. It is either a composite or a prime. If it is a prime, then we are done. Else, it has prime factorization (axiom: unique factorization in $\RingNat$) and again, we are done.

\begin{theorem}
If $r$ is irrational then $\sqrt{r}$ is also irrational.\\
If $\sqrt{r}$ is rational then $r$ is rational.
\end{theorem}

%What is the contrapositive of the above statement? 

\begin{definition}[Contrapozitive]
The contrapositive of ``if $P$ then $Q$'' is ``if $\neg Q$ then $\neg P$''
\end{definition}


\begin{proof}
Suppose $\sqrt{r}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{r}= p/q$ for $p,q \in \RingInt$. Therefore, $r = p^2/q^2$. 
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Proof by contradiction: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.}

\begin{proof}
Suppose not. Then there exists $p,q \in \RingInt$ such that $\sqrt{2}=p/q,$ where $p,q$ do not have any common divisors. Therefore, $2q^2 = p^2$, i.e. $p^2$ is even. \\

\textcolor{blue}{(CW2.1)} If $p^2$ is even, then $p$ is even. 


(why?) \\
Suppose not, i..e $p^2$ is even but $p$ is not. Then $p = 2k +1$ for some integer $k$. $p^2 = (2k+1)^2=
4k^2+4k +1$. As $4(k^2+k)$ is even,  $4k^2+4k +1$ is odd, which is a contradiction.\\



Therefore, $p=2k$ for some $k \in \RingInt$ $\Rightarrow$ $2q^2 = 4k^2$ $\Rightarrow$ $q^2 = 2k^2$ $\Rightarrow$ $q^2$ is even. Therefore, $q$ is even. That is, $p,q$ have a common factor. This leads to a contradiction.

%The well-ordering principle (which we will assume as one of our axioms) is:
\begin{axiom}[WOP]
Every nonempty set of non-negative integers has a smallest element. 
\end{axiom}


\begin{axiom}[Induction]
Let $P(n)$ be a property of non-negative integers. If 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(0)$ is true (Base case)
\item for all $n \geq 0$, $P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$ (Induction step)
\end{enumerate}
then $P(n)$ is true for for all $n \in \RingNat$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Strong Induction]
Let $P(n)$ be a property of non-negative integers. If 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(0)$ is true (Base case)
\item $[\forall k \in \{0,1, \ldots, n\}: P(k)] \Rightarrow P(n+1)$ (Induction step)

then $P(n)$ is true for for all $n \in \RingNat$.

\frametitle{WOP $\Rightarrow$ Induction}
\begin{theorem}
Well-ordering principle implies Induction
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $P(0)$ be true and for each $n \geq 0$, let $P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$. \\
Let us assume for the sake of contradiction that $P(n)$ is not true for all positive integers. \\
Let $C = \{i \mid P(i) \mbox{ is false}\}$. As $C$ is non-empty and non-negative integers $C$ has a smallest element (due to WOP), say $i_0$.\\
Now, $i_0\neq 0$. Also $P(i_0-1)$ is true, as $i_0-1$ is not in $C$. But $P(i_0-1) \Rightarrow P(i_0)$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\frametitle{Using Induction to prove theorems}
\begin{theorem}
$2^n \leq (n+1)!$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Base case ($n=0$): $2^0 = 1 = 1!$\\

Induction hypothesis: $2^n \leq (n+1)!$. 
\begin{align*}
2^{n+1} & = 2 \cdot 2^n \\
& \leq 2 \cdot (n+1)! \mbox{     (by indiction hypothesis)}\\
& \leq (n+2) \cdot (n+1)! \\

 \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Using Well-ordering principle to prove theorems}
Here is a slightly non-trivial example. The following equation does not have any solutions over $\RingNat:$\\

$4a^3+2b^3 = c^3$


\begin{proof}
Suppose (for the sake of contradiction) this has a solution over $\RingNat.$ \\
%Let $S$ be a set of solutions.\\
Let $(A,B,C)$ be the solution with the smallest value of $b$ in $S$. \\

(Such an $s$ exists due to WOP.) 

Observe that $C^3$ is even. Therefore, $C$ is even. Say $C = 2\gamma$. \\
Therefore, $4A^3 + 2B^3 = 8\gamma^3,$ i.e. $2A^3 + B^3 = 4\gamma^3$. \\

Now, $B^3$ is even and so is $B$. Say $B = 2\beta$. $\therefore 2A^3 + 8\beta^3 = 4\gamma^3$.\\

And, now we can repeat the argument with respect to $A$. \\
Therefore, if $(A,B,C)$ is a solution then so is $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.\\

But $\beta < B$, which is a contradiction.

There are no positive integer solutions over $\RingInt$ to the
equation:
$$a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4$$

Integer values for $a, b, c, d$ that do satisfy this equation were first discovered in
1986. \\

For all $2 \leq i \leq j, i,j \in \RingNat$ let $f(i,j) = \sqrt{i\sqrt{i+1\ldots \sqrt{j}}}$. \\
We will prove a slightly more general statement:\\
For all $2 \leq i \leq j, i,j \in \RingNat, f(i,j) < i+1$\\

f(i,j+1) &= \sqrt{i\cdot f(i+1,j+1)}

$a\in \RingReal$, $a>0$. Then, $\forall n \in \RingNat$, $a^n = 1$.

\begin{proof}[By Strong Induction]
Base case: $n=0$. So $a^n=1$.\\

Induction: $n\rightarrow n+1$. \\

\[
a^{n+1} = \frac{a^n\cdot a^n}{a^{n-1}} = \frac{1\cdot 1}{1} = 1

{\bf The barber's dilema}\\

Once upon a time there was a kingdom in which the king ordered the barber to shave only those who 
do not shave themselves! 


Of course, barber could neither shave himself and nor could he not shave himself!\\

This is called a paradox.\\

Why did the paradox arise?

Start with a few objects {\it defined} as sets. Now if $A$ is a set and $P$ is a property,

Why does this definition get rid of Russell's paradox?

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $P(x) = x \notin x$. Suppose $A$ is a set and let $S = \{x \in A \mid x \notin x\}$.


\begin{itemize}
\item ($S \in S$:) from the definition of $S$, $S \in A$ and $S \notin S$, which is a contradiction.
\item ($S \notin S$:) from the definition, either $S \notin A$ or $S \in S$. But we have assumed that $S \notin S$, therefore it must mean $S \notin A$.  There is no contradiction!
